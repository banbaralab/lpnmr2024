# ASP-based Large Neighborhood Prioritized Search for Course Timetabling

<!-- The heulingo solver is an ASP-based implementation of Large Neighborhood Prioritized Search (LNPS). -->
<!-- LNPS is an integration of systematic prioritized-search and SLS-based large neighborhood search -->
<!-- for solving combinatorial optimization problems. -->
<!-- LNPS starts with an initial solution and then iteratively tries to find improved solutions -->
<!-- by alternately destroying and prioritized-searching a current incumbent solution. -->
<!-- LNPS can not only find near-optimal solutions within a reasonable amount of computation time -->
<!-- but also guarantee the optimality of obtained solutions. -->

## Requirements
- [clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/) version 5.6 or higher
